## Overview
#### In the coming up years there will be numerous amounts of employees that will be elgible for retirement.  A high number of senior staff will be retiring and therefore Pewlett-Hackard will need to fill these positions with the help of a mentorship program.  This report was created using an ERD, SQL tables and queries.  

## Silver Tsunami Results
#### Two points to be taken away from the Pewlett_Hackard Silver Tsunami Report using data from 1952 -1955.
- Senior Staff will have the highest retirement number.
- Managers will have the lowest retirement number.

#### By using an ERD, SQL queries and tables for staff born in the 1965 year, the report found two interesting points.
